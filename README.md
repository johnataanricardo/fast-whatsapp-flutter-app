# Front-end Auth with Firebase

This is my first Flutter application, this is an App that allows users to start a conversation on WhatsApp without adding the contact to their contact list, just select the DDI, set the number and the message, and choose the options of Copy Link or Start WhatsApp. The application has the Dark and Light Theme and the languages English and Portuguese, by default the selected DDI is +55 Brazil, but after the user changes the DDI it is saved in the storage used by the App.

## Project setup
```
flutter pub get
```

### Project development run
